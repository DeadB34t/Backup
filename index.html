    <p>What is “version control”, and why should you care? Version control is a system that records changes to a file
        or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. <br> For the examples in this book,
        you
        will use software source code as the files being version controlled, though in reality you can do this with
        nearly any type of file on a computer.</p>
    <p>Git local repository is the one on which we will make local changes, typically this local repository is on our
        computer. <br>Git remote repository is the one of the server, typically a machine situated at 42 miles away.</p>
    <p>GitHub is a web-based version-control and collaboration platform for software developers. ... GitHub, which is
        delivered through a software-as-a-service (SaaS) business model,<br> was started in 2008 and was founded on Git, an
        open source code management system created by Linus Torvalds to make software builds faster.</p>
